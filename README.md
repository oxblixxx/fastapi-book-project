## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- pytest
- uvicorn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hng12-devbotops/fastapi-book-project.git
cd fastapi-book-project
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

Features
RESTful API: CRUD operations for managing books.

Dockerized: Easy to deploy using Docker.

CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.

Nginx Reverse Proxy: Nginx is used as a reverse proxy for the FastAPI application.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.9

Docker

Docker Compose (optional, for local development)

Git

Nginx (on the deployment server)

Setup
Local Development
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/oxblixxx/fastapi-book-project.git
cd fastapi-book-project
Set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
Access the API:
Open your browser or use a tool like curl or Postman to access the API at http://localhost:8000.

Docker Setup
Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy
docker build -t fastapi-app .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy
docker run -d --name fastapi-app -p 8000:8000 fastapi-app
Access the API:
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.

Running Tests
To run the tests locally:

Install test dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run pytest:

bash
Copy
pytest
CI/CD Pipeline
The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The pipeline consists of two jobs:

Test Job:

Runs on pull requests to the main branch.

Executes pytest to ensure all tests pass.

Deploy Job:

Runs on pushes to the main branch (after a pull request is merged).

Deploys the application to the server using Docker and updates Nginx.

Deployment
Server Setup
Install Docker:
Follow the official Docker installation guide for your server's operating system.

Install Nginx:
Install Nginx and configure it to act as a reverse proxy for the FastAPI application.

Set up SSH Access:
Ensure the server is accessible via SSH and the necessary secrets (SSH_HOST, SSH_USER, SSH_KEY, SSH_PORT) are configured in the GitHub repository.

Deployment Process
Merge a Pull Request:
When a pull request is merged into the main branch, the deploy job is triggered.

Automatic Deployment:
The deploy job:

Builds and runs the Docker container.

Updates the Nginx configuration and restarts Nginx.

Access the Deployed Application:
The application will be available at your server's domain or IP address.
